# dotfiles
My dotfiles collection :) 

I have not created an installation script which automatically installs important applications and symlinks all the dotfiles to the proper locations, and also, some important tools are not included here, such as: 
1. oh-my-zsh
2. Ulauncher with Dracula Theme
3. tldr, rg, fzf, ncdu, btop, iotop, lazy-docker
4. bluetooth manager (blueman)
5. JetBrains toolbox
6. Chinese Keyboard (Rime)
7. Firefox
